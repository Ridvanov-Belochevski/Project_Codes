# Project_Codes

Created initially for personal use, Project_Codes is a python module that simplifies the extraction of projects data from the World Bank Standard Reports data platform. It offers a collection of classes and functions which accept arguments that allows the user to specify the parameters of the data to be extracted and returns the data extracted as a Pandas DataFrame. The module also allows the user to perform simple aggregation and visualization of projects data by key variables such as Approval Fiscal Year, Regions, Global Practice, Lending Instrument, Sectors and Theme portfolio data.
